# Go (Golang) Learning Roadmap ‚Äî Detailed Breakdown

## 1. Introduction & Setup
- What is Go? History and philosophy (simplicity, concurrency, compiled)
- Install Go (from [go.dev](https://go.dev/dl/))
- Set up Go environment variables (`GOROOT`, `GOPATH`, `PATH`)
- Go workspace: Modules (`go mod`), project structure
- Run your first Go program (`go run`, `go build`)

---

## 2. Go Basics
- Program structure (`package main`, `func main`)
- Variables and constants (`var`, `const`, type inference with `:=`)
- Basic data types: `int`, `float64`, `string`, `bool`
- Printing with `fmt.Println`, `fmt.Printf`
- Comments (single-line `//`, multi-line `/* ... */`)
- Functions
  - Declaration, parameters, return values
  - Multiple return values
  - Named return values
- Control flow
  - `if`, `else`, short variable declaration in `if`
  - `switch` (including type switches)
  - `for` loop (as `while`, infinite, range loop)
- Scope (block, function, package)

---

## 3. Data Structures and Core Concepts
- Arrays (fixed size, zero values)
- Slices (dynamic, backing arrays, slicing, append)
- Maps (creation, assignment, lookup, deletion, existence check)
- Structs (declaration, fields, instantiation, anonymous structs)
- Pointers
  - Declaration, dereferencing, passing by reference
  - Pointers to structs
- Methods (receiver types: value vs pointer)
- Interfaces
  - Declaration, implementation (implicit)
  - Empty interface (`interface{}`)
  - Type assertions, type switches

---

## 4. Packages & Modules
- Importing standard library packages
- Creating custom packages (folder structure, `init()` function)
- Exported vs unexported identifiers (capitalization)
- Using third-party packages (`go get`, `go mod tidy`)
- Go Modules: `go.mod`, `go.sum`, replacing modules, versioning

---

## 5. Error Handling
- The `error` type
- Returning and handling errors
- Creating custom error types
- `errors.New`, `fmt.Errorf` (wrapping errors)
- Panic and recover

---

## 6. Go Standard Library Highlights
- `fmt` (formatting)
- `io` and `io/ioutil` (reading/writing)
- `os` (file and environment operations)
- `bufio` (buffered I/O)
- `flag` (command-line arguments)
- `time` (timers, durations, formatting)
- `strings` and `strconv` (string manipulation, conversion)

---

## 7. Concurrency (Go‚Äôs Superpower)
- Goroutines (`go` keyword)
- Channels (creation, sending/receiving, closing, range over channels)
- Buffered vs unbuffered channels
- Select statement (multiplexing)
- WaitGroups (`sync.WaitGroup`)
- Mutexes (`sync.Mutex`, `sync.RWMutex`)
- Common concurrency patterns (worker pools, fan-in/fan-out)

---

## 8. File I/O, Networking, and Web Development
- Reading/writing files (`os`, `io/ioutil`, `bufio`)
- Directory operations
- Building an HTTP server (`net/http`)
  - Handlers and routing
  - Serving static files
  - Templates (`html/template`)
- HTTP client (making HTTP requests)
- Working with JSON (`encoding/json`)

---

## 9. Testing and Tooling
- Writing tests (`*_test.go`, `testing` package)
- Table-driven tests
- Benchmarking (`go test -bench`)
- Test coverage
- Code formatting (`gofmt`)
- Linting (`golint`, `staticcheck`)
- Dependency management (`go mod` commands)
- Profiling (`pprof`)

---

## 10. Advanced Topics
- Context (`context.Context`, cancellation, timeouts)
- Embedding structs and interfaces
- Reflection (`reflect` package)
- Generics (type parameters, `any`, constraints) [Go 1.18+]
- Building and using plugins
- Custom error handling (wrapping, unwrapping, `%w` in `fmt.Errorf`)
- Signals and graceful shutdown (`os/signal`, `context`)

---

## 11. Deployment & Ecosystem
- Building static binaries (`go build`)
- Cross-compilation (`GOOS`, `GOARCH`)
- Dockerizing Go applications
- Environmental configuration
- Logging (standard library and popular logging libraries)
- Common frameworks and libraries:
  - Web: Gin, Echo, Fiber, Chi
  - CLI: Cobra, urfave/cli
  - ORM/DB: GORM, sqlx

---

## 12. Real-World Mini Projects (Practice)
- CLI tool (e.g., simple todo list)
- REST API server (CRUD operations)
- Static website server (your portfolio site!)
- Web scraper (concurrent goroutines)
- Chat server (WebSockets)
- Worker pool with concurrency

---

## 13. Next Steps & Community
- Explore open-source Go projects on GitHub
- Join Go communities: [Gopher Slack](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/), Reddit r/golang, Go Forum
- Contribute to Go projects
